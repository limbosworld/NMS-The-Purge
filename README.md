# The Purge

A save game file for normal mode players who want to skip most of the main missions which have been around (unchanged) for years and get straight to exploring, building and/or doing other quests like A Trace of Metal, Under a Rebel Star or other quests.

## Description

If you are a long-time player or chronic restarter (like me), this will help you each time you want to start a new save. When you load this save, you will be about 5 minutes away from completing The Purge which is the last of the main storyline missions.
#### This quick start save is also great to use for testing and tinkering without having to listen to Artemis, Apollo or Null pinging you in the background. Hack away at the save file and if something goes wrong, just re-paste this JSON and start over.

3.  As soon as it loads and you gather ferrite dust to fix your scanner, head to the crashed ship. Get in ond out of your ship to save
4.  Quit the game
5.  Open NMSSaveEditor and open the newly created save - Make sure you are on the right one
6.  Click Edit Raw JSON
7.  Select all code and delete it

#### When you start your new save, you will now be on a very nice paradise planet with blue grass, sky and water. The portal will be flaged with a red final interface marker. Next to a portal is a simple base. When you activate the portal and enter, you will soon be in front of the Atlas and be able to pick your new galaxy. Put down a base computer and teleporter somewhere so you can travel back and forth between Euclid and your new galaxy.

### Note:
* It took approx. 6 hours of playtime to get to this point in the save. However, if you want to have reset the in-game playtime to 0:00 to give you a better idea of your own progress from this point on though the game.
