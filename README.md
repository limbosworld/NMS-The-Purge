# The Purge

A custom mode save game file for players who want to skip most of the main missions which have been around (mainly unchanged) for years and get straight to exploring, building and/or doing other quests like A Trace of Metal, Under a Rebel Star or the many other new quests and expeditions.

## Description

If you are a long-time player or chronic restarter (like me), this will help you each time you want to start a new save. When you load this save, you will be about 5 minutes away from completing The Purge which is the last of the main storyline missions.
#### This quick start save is also great to use for testing and tinkering without having to listen to Artemis, Apollo or -null- pinging you in the background. Hack away at the save file and if something goes wrong, just re-paste this JSON and start over.

## Below is a list of quests or missions and their status in this save file.

### Primary missions

* Awakenings [Completed](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Awakenings)
* The Atlas Path [Completed](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/The_Atlas_Path#The_Final_Atlas_Interface) .. By that, I mean the part where you collect all the seeds and birth a new star was completed. This mission tends to repeat itself even after you complete it though. Read about it in the [Wiki](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/The_Atlas_Path#Completion_and_Mission_Log)

### Secondary missions

* Expanding the Base
    * Base Computer Archives [It Never Ends](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Computer_Archives) .. There still seems to be bug that puts you in an endless loop, so I decided not to try to do anything with this.
    * Scientific Research [Completed](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Scientific_Research)
    * Weapons Research [Completed](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons_Research)

* Starbirth ______________ Not Started
* The Settlers ___________ Not Started
* A Trace of Metal ______ Not Started
* Under A Rebel Star ___ Not Started
* There are many more missions and quests that were never done. Additionally, this save file is an offline project, so no multiplayer or expeditions were ever undertaken.

### Steps

1.  Back up your save folder
2.  Start a new custom save
3.  As soon as it loads, get in ond out of your ship or give the game long enough to make an auto-save
4.  Quit the game
5.  Open NMSSaveEditor and open the newly created save - Make sure you are on the right one
6.  Click Edit Raw JSON
7.  Select all code and delete it
8.  Open the JSON file you downloaded with a suitable editor like Sublime Text or Notepad++ 
9.  Copy and paste all code into the Raw JSON editor.
10. Close the raw JSON window and save. Also, click save changes before closing the save editor.

#### When you start your new save, you will now be on a paradise planet with a small base. A portal will be flaged with a red final interface marker on another planet in your system. Go into space and you will see it. When you activate the portal and enter, you will soon be in front of the Atlas and be able to pick your new galaxy. Put down a base computer and teleporter somewhere in your new galaxy so you can travel back and forth between Euclid and your new galaxy.

You don't have to complete The Purge right away. Now that it's flagged, it will just remain in your log until you are ready do so.

### Note:
* This was done on NMS 4.08 and with the help of NMSSaveEditor 1.11.3 (the goatfungus one). I would be happy to post another save editor's file on Github if someone want's to convert it for me.

* There is almost 6 hours of playtime which was mostlty spent warping back and forth between planets, clicking countless dialog boxes and performing all those tasks the game sends you on. It's not hard doing those missions (especially in creative mode) ... it just takes time getting through it all.

* Don't forget to change your game mode or difficulty settings to what you like... then get a better multi-tool, ship and freighter.
#### Happy hunting travler!
